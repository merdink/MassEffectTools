Attempts to create a ME2 Face Code for people who have imported from ME1.

You'll need php to run the script, the latest versions have the ability to run a server locally.
Make sure to edit the file and change the filename so it uses the right save file.
No need to make that YAML file anymore, the script will take the data from the save file and create the face code.
